### Meeting Notes:

* How to connect the 2 project ideas and desired outcomes of project and leadership program
* How do I talk about my experience advocating into communicating my leadership skills.
* Example:  I made my OA week advocacy align with adminstrative missions other initiatives (Emma has a worksheet for this)
* Not just library administration, but leadership in other areas (grant funders, scholarly societies, publishers?)
* Lots of what we're chatting about at the moment fits really well into SPARC's professional development webcasts. 
  * Webcast strategy, in three parts
    1 Webcasts (hopefully without too much zoning out)
    2 Post-webcast twitter chats
    3 Twitter chats
   ... combined makes not just a webcast! Turn it into a conversation.

Summary:
* set of resources that's generated & distributed between now & october focusing on:
  *  Info / practical resource for oa, ECL, career advancement. How to think about it, advice from existing leaders, then a tangiable "thing" (e.g webcast)
  *  Iterative resources that speak to "what you gonna do for oa week". They're community focused, but still speak to leadership. E.g do a review of campus leadership objectives, and see how your oa workshop fits into that. 

<!-- not sure if I got those bits -->

* Instead of just reporting out what you do for OA week, report out what you did AND what skills you learned / connections you made.

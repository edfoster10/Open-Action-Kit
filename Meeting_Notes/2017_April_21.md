## Agenda
* Recap last call and emerging vision for this project.
* [Open Canvas](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HbOiqx6SOk-XNNRt38G2RLAepNzq5gbGW7Nr-8xyLps/edit#slide=id.gef2e83792_0_66) for project refinement and strategy development (possible tool to aid our work).
* Discuss project rhythm (two week sprints?) and immediate next steps.

## Notes

**Vision**: An ECL Professional Development group
**Next step**: Start with a project - see who shows up. Then, bootstrap up a coordinating committee.
**Project idea**: Doing something around Open Access Week. Lots of visibility, lots of CV points, lots of relavence to what we're actually wanting to do in future (could start small projects that become big projects later).

+1's from many. 
Nice to work on something with existing boundaries & context. 
SPARC coordinates Open Access Week, and Nick leads that.

Last week Robin did a [local WOW](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/events/working-open-workshop-february-2016). Great as teaches great technicques from open source to folks who don't code. 

When do we need to release deliverables for different groups to plan, view, etc. 

# Open Canvas

We can use this canvas to structure & think about our work :D

## Product

### Problem

1.Attract Early Career librarians and advocates to the Leadership Program project via Open Access Week Project /Provide impactful or tangible open leadership opportunities for early career libs 
2. Create an project for Open Access Week 2017/   Provides libraries and librarians with actionable resources for successfully and creatively engaging their campus communities about openness during International Open Access Week.
3. Opportunities beyond OA Week - what can we do all year long and not just during October? 
4. (Lauren asks) Is the ultimate goal of this program to get more OpenCon-affiliated librarian types into leadership positions? If so, there should be a statement here to that effect. e.g. "Paths to leadership for scholarly communications professionals can be difficult to navigate." Then a solution, "Equip early career librarians with skills and experiences that will help them pursue leadership positions and advocate for Open in those positions." 

### Solution
(Potential)

1. Collect expereinces from librarians and admins about spreading OA awarness and participation (e.g. Past OA Weeks, Local Impacts/ Examples of Openness, What it's like to host, what they have learned)
    - Fits into "Open in Order to..." theme for 2017
    - Could highlight boots-on-the-ground work done to increase openness
    - Fit in with other university initiatives if possible or applicable, connect with other leaders on campus.

2.Create a document like [100 Stories of Impact](https://works.bepress.com/jean_gabriel_bankier/27/) but including those who do not have bepress as well as the experiences of those hosting events
    - This could help out another OpenCon project/ research/ Tracking Open Impact others are working on as well
### Key Metrics
    -questions here (these are from Lauren): What would be the best outcome for this project? What are we looking to do? Some ideas: get more OpenCon-affiliated librarians in leadership positions. With whom? Where? How do we track that? 
    -potential ideas for this: collect info about participants now, where they are, what their management duties are. go through this program, and then ask them to identify other positions / projects / leadership opportunities to go for. then follow up 1 year later?  
### Resources Required
1. Visible, Accessible space to view or use the project delieverables (if any)
2. Resources to teach leadership skills (what are these?)
3. Contributors
4. Translations?

2 week sprints
Hard deadline of October Open Access Week 2017
Communication using Slack, avoiding emails
Time (considering time zones)
Considerations:
1. Timeline including events leading up to OA Week
2. Later...create a roadmap for the project and timeline
3. Tools for deliverables, variables, etc.(Github, perhaps?...perhaps SPARC's github??)
4. Open work and provinence documentation for people coming in on the project later fill

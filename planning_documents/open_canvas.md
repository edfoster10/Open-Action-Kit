## Open Canvas Excercise - Part 1. 

### Problem

* Paths to leadership for scholarly communications professionals can be difficult to navigate.
* ECL scholarly communication and OA advocates need more tangiable leadership opportunitis to advance their careers.
* Face-to-Face campus OA Week events aren't well attended beyond our established core audiences.

### Solution

* Equip early career librarians with skills, experiences, and "products" that will help them pursue leadership positions and advocate for Open in those positions. 
* Collect, create, and distribute material that OA advocates can reuse and remix for building enthusiasm for OA week and hosting in-person events.
  * This might include:
    * Success & experience stories
      * Leverage "Open in Order to..." theme for 2017
      * Could highlight boots-on-the-ground work done to increase openness
      * Fit in with other university initiatives if possible or applicable, connect with other leaders on campus.
    * Documents like [100 Stories of Impact](https://works.bepress.com/jean_gabriel_bankier/27/)
    * Workshops with remixable content that fit with the Open in Order to Theme.
    * Provide assessment ideas that meaasure advocacy success beyone bodies in the room.
* A weekly action guide / blog! With the actions and resources getting bigger between now and October.
  * Resources attached to this could be email templates.
  * Awesome looking flyers and stickers.
  * Remixable workshop content.
* Provide navigation information for alternative ways of advancement.  Sit down with David Lewis and other leaders for informational interviews on this topic.
    
### Key Metrics
* We have two meaurement needs:
  * The efficacy of uptake and usefulness the materials / campaign we create for OA week.
  * The efficacy of our program to provide leadership opportunities for ECLs.
    * Here, we would be trying to measure recognition, career progress, etc.

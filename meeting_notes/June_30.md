        * Team to look for and share existing templates for topics listed
    * October: Robin & Chealsye 
        * October is two themes of information: last minute details to get action up and running & preparing for assessment and telling stories of success.
        * "Tips & Tricks" (first half) delivered first on the website--early October; storytelling/assessment portion delivered mid-October (right before OA week)
    * November: Lauren & Emma 
        * Self-promotion discussion happening on Twitter (Charlotte Roh and Jill Ciceselo) (wrong spelling, Emma will fix)
        * Thinking about logistics of CV/resume strength building/workshop
        * Connecting the October assessment with the November "CV" self-promotion
* Discussion of how to finalize and move forward on monthly plans
    * July, August have a moving forward plan 
    * September, October, November need additional time for brainstorming/development 
    * Emma will email out about execution plans--do not need have final items delivered, just a plan on how to deliver. 
        * We spearhead execution plan, community to give feedback more on deliverables portion
        * Make sure we have forums for feedback, can encorporate suggestions into future communications/deliverables for next year 
* Website and communication go-live
    * Logistics: how do we solicit feedback? Website to have built in feedback mechanisms? 
        * Because it's GitHub website, can build architecture into repo that provide cotnribution guidelines and venues
        * Can be accessed through website or through back end repository version
        * Bake into website multiple opportunities to contribute; don't make GitHub a barrier; use something like a Google doc that we can integrate
        * Get feedback on personas; include in next ECL call (let people know why we're doing this, give them opportunity in doc to comment/add); add to July communication
    * July 18 deadline for a straight-forward front page website
    * Will have Slack convo for the additional logistics of the page
* Action items
    * Flesh out Readme file; provide more details about communication and contribution once we've made more decisions
    * RC to ping about GitHub/markdown tutorial next week

### Meeting Chair:  Lauren! (who was often likened to Daria by high school friends both sartorially and behaviorally...) :eyes::metal::notes::sunny::mouse::volcano:
* Communication Action Plan for Released Deliverables (things we need):
    * Core message for SPARC to send out (text)
        * Nick e-mailed Heather Wednesday
        * Target was to get msg out on 9/8 but may need to be moved. There are some suggested tweets. 
        * We need text, probably from Heather, and Nick to send out next week. 
    * Communication target date ([from spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UkZ2UNWv4fNASyUMpN2jDulZXn9J9LcFl2XnYQNaSSA/edit#) )
        * Nick to check internally if there is other communication going out. 
    * Organizating team follow-up with personal tweets and messages to lists.
        * Create list spreadsheet to avoid duplication.
            * We checked the list of email lists - are there more to add? 

* September
    * Think through best package/s of deliverables that incorporates things we planned to, but did not deliver in August.
        * There are some things that we had talked about releasing with the materials in e-mail, but are not present. 
            * Curated resource list - is this done? is it ready for the GitHub site in August package? LC will @ CT on slack to find out.
                * Lauren asked Camille about the status of this on Slack.  
                * Camille says: It should be ready to go. I don't think it's only in docs not GitHub because it's a living document
            * Environmental inventory is being pushed back, not ready yet. 
            * Blog post needs to be published or going live at the same time as e-mail. Who is in charge of this? Robin? 
    * Status updates (if folks are on call :smile:)
        * Show & Tell blog interviews
            * Chealsye is in charge of this. Cheasye, can you give an update in Slack? Heather needs to update schedule with release dates. 
        * Twitter chats - 
            * Lauren's update: September 19 at 3pm Eastern. [Questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KeuBeU9tvgmakxKDc52NziE5aeT96lZ-bgoOraZHSbk/edit) are loaded and ready to go out on that date and scattered through the hour. Will advertise in next OpenCon librarian call. Ask that all of us try to be there for this and respond to at least a couple of Qs to get the conversation going, also share on your personal Twitter to encourage participation! Tag people in your tweets leading up to it, maybe reach out to a couple of select folks about participating. 
            * Going to use #openpros hashtag; folks are already following it and #oaweek   
    * Nick showed the work on this project to Heather Joseph who was really really excited. 
    * Nick: action quiz that somewhat overlaps with the quiz Camille made. Nick says they might reprioritize the resources they have available 
        * Pretty optimistic about a lightweight microsite a few weeks before OA Week w/this content; inventory about positive stories of impact of Open
        * Possibly on an 'openinorderto' domain - openinorder.to/raise-my-visibility e.g. 
    * Nick has draft versions of brand new OA week posters: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BzoihPPmTTO6dVBCRDhWN2xXSEE 
        * Reusing this imagery for social media, instagram etc. 
        * There is also a blank "open in order to..." graphic: http://api.ning.com/files/PyPlrJLAwZcblY5ygMFuzhgE1l1rlt4hkQY6SL2Oq3qlpe1EmILT9F9SUdb2VXODmF0B-b3WGtbGl8TDbmvt1Vxl9VMVX69x/OAWeek2017WebsiteBanner01.png?width=500

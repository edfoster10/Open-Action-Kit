### Meeting Chair:  Ali! :cake: :star: :guitar: :penguin: 
## Agenda
* [Progress and review discussion of early August deliverables](https://github.com/sparcopen/Open-Action-Kit/blob/master/monthly_deliverables/august/deliverable-tasks.md)
    * Curated list of resources (Ali & Robin)
        * Used Lorraine Cheun's schema to describe resources and added a few other things (no reinventing the wheel, can allow us to contribute to her list as well)
        * Speak to Camille and Emma's categories (awareness, event, etc.)
        * Once released, will be encouraging people to contribute directly to the list; build it and feed it back in to Lorraine's list
        * Question from HC: can we submit URLs to internet archive so they don't disappear? RC: totally! RC and AV will double check that nothing has DOI
        * CT: Consider spreadsheet format? 
            * Sounds good - will migrate.
        * Feel free to add things (and/or jazz up descriptions)
    * Environmental mapping instructions (Emma)
        * Putting the final touches on now--I've also made updates to the "Worksheet" itself. I'd really like to get the worksheet out of google docs and into a format that better fits the content. (Ideas? Something that allows for flowchart-type stuff?)
        * For flowcharts (http://twinery.org/)--thank you!Also looking for others from colleagues
        * Maybe a video tutorial expanding on the different sections and what they mean. How they can be maybe put into another document like a report or something
        * For instructions: Do you think it is more helpful to have completed worksheet, or to provide step-by-step?
        * [Here is the worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v5rOBWJ2yScyx_JWaA261uewwna-I9hWgrBPsi2CUNE/edit)
        * Figure out how to present instructions (2-3 minute video?)
            * This would be really easy for me (emma) to do--we have "one button" recording studios on my campus. I just booked a space for Tuesday--I'll shoot you the final result next week!
            * from Lauren - let me know when you're done w/video and instructions, I'll follow them to fill out the worksheet in my context, then it can be feedback on the instructions AND a sample worksheet
        * HC: What does end product look like? Maybe we should provide an example. Maybe we could fill out the worksheets ourselves? LC is doing in another context so may be able to help here. (See above comment)
    * * Quiz (Camille)
        * Camille: I made some changes yesterday and now it's broken lol. So I'm having a developer at TTU (and maybe Joe)look at the code. Hopefully it will be up and running today. 
        * Is a bit of a cushion in terms of timeline; so we have time in the schedule
    * Activity check list (Emma & Camille)

        * From Emma: Ideas for the activism? What I drafted almost mirrored Camille's "Awareness" section
https://docs.google.com/document/d/16PM1MQ32BgmcQ1jLiA5b1bq7gN3-RXiGi-vMFV5pV28/edit
        * Camille borrowed from her own experiences and thinking through the main event types for each category.
        * If you think there's something there that should be added, please add.
        * Really nice in that the space can be overwhelming.  The tools for this month pull things together.
        * Consideration: can we package things so people can download whole thing? Few options: GitHub site, configure repo with a folder so people can download in zip file, or package it up in Google Drive and link off of ReadMe; good to have multiple options for people who feel more/less comfortable with certain tools
            * What about metrics (# of folks who downloaded)? 
            * Should it be a different format? Considerations for sharing: FigShare (doi), OSS, Zenodo (syncs up with GitHub, work together, allows for archiving of repo with doi: bonuses (open source! free!), Lauren can put into altmetrics account to see who's tweeting)
            * Helpful to think about how we could translate these tasks into task management system? Suggestion: demo using Trello, or screencap using TRello
            * visual example or screen capture
            * if you want a timeline based thing, this is how it would look. 
            * HC to complete
    * * Timeline info graphic (Camille)
        * Done and in [Github](https://github.com/sparcopen/Open-Action-Kit/blob/master/monthly_deliverables/august/OpenAccessWeekTimeline.pdf) :smiley:
* Questions/updates on later August deliverables
    * What's up with the Twitter chats? (Lauren asks!)
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/gcajW7oKirCdW/giphy.gif)
        * Success stories would form the content for Twitter chats; people could chime in and participate; might tie in with/lead into assessment
        * Idea is to get questions prepared, but not necessarily do Twitter chats in August - it would feed into assessment discussions.
        * There are some notes the promotion schedule about timing.
            * Having one ealier might be helpful, as we could get some inspirational examples.
            * Thinking ahead to talking about successes, maybe we can make some templates.
                * If we did something earlier and asked these questions, it could feed into later months.  And we would be giving people something to aim for.
                * What if we framed the Twitter chat a little differently - how do you assess your project? How do you tell tell a story?
                    * Heather would be happy to help with that - aiming for mid to late September.
                    * Has been added to the promotion calendar
                    * Capture in a Storify.
                    * Do another Twitter in November, would be more de-briefed orriented.  
                        * how did you measure success.
                        * what went well, what didn't
                        * did you learn any lessons
                        * post OA week debrief.
                        * link to their materials.
                        * iterative and built on itself.
                        * Use #openpros hashtag
    * Release Schedule
    * How do we want to present/deliver deliverables:
        * On web
        * As one folder in repo
        * One file or PDF
* [Promotion schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UkZ2UNWv4fNASyUMpN2jDulZXn9J9LcFl2XnYQNaSSA/edit#heading=h.1udsy6hao1q6) / Action items
    * HC has time blocked off on Monday to work on this, will ping us for extra eyes
    * Emma and Heather working on integrating dates and making sure everything is covered.
    * We'll create a public doc that says this is what is happening and this is when it's coming at you.
    * What to promote, when, and how.
    * Need to assign weeks, so it's not just one person all the time.
        * Tweets - through Nick/SPARC
        * Emails - will be drafting and getting out to us early next week. 
        * Ali and Heather will work on splitting some of this work up.
        * Want to approach iteratively, but also 
* [Contributor guide](https://github.com/sparcopen/Open-Action-Kit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
    * Tried to make as lightweight and accessible as possible
    * Take a look at it - feel free to edit it yourself or suggest to Robin
    * As we release deliverables and ask for things from community, can update this to speak to specific deliverables
* [Thinking forward to September](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v32spdz-ejuEQ83GC9iY_YH1HiYd3lhAD_Ddc0KfdbE/edit)

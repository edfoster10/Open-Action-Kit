General notes and Questions:  

* We'll use the OpenCon call as soft launch, then work with Heather Nick to get more substantive email out the following week.

* Quizz connection to Mozilla quizz Joe was adapting...
    * Chealsye and Camille don't think two quizes are problematic.
        * Could see the quizes speaking to each other.
        * Camille's quiz is more about planning, while Joe's quizz is more action based quiz taken during oa week.
        * We'll think about it over next couple days, but sounds like we'll just keep them separate.

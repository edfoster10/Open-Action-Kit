This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [OpenCon Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sparcopen/opencon/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.MD). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.  

## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!

[You can email anyone on the Open Action Kit organizing team with your question](https://sparcopen.github.io/Open-Action-Kit/team) or [submitt an issue](https://github.com/sparcopen/Open-Action-Kit/issues/new).  Either way, we'll get back to you as soon as possible. :whale::pizza::soon: 

## How Can I Contribute?

The Open Action Toolkit includes monthly communications and resources for advancing and advocating for **open access** **open data** and **open education**.  We plan to address some of the following themes and could use your help:

* Exploring and choosing your action
* Crafting your message and inspiring engagement
* Getting to the finish line and connecting with other OA champions
* Telling the story of your efforts and successes

We want to know about your ideas, work, and go-to resources for advancing openness.  Are you planning something awesome for Open Access Week 2017?  What cool stuff have you created that others can use?  Can you point us to useful models, guides, lists, or outreach materials that other people have created?  Let us know, and we'll highlight them in the Open Action Kit's monthly communication and resources.  

### Issues

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Atom. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report :pencil:, reproduce the behavior :computer: :computer:, and find related reports :mag_right:.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Pull Request

* **Check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/).** You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem [in the latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version), if the problem happens when you run Atom in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode), and if you can get the desired behavior by changing [Atom's or packages' config settings](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-atom-and-package-settings).
* **Check the [FAQs on the forum](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)** for a list of common questions and problems.
* **Determine [which repository the problem should be reported in](#atom-and-packages)**.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

### Feedback From

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined [which repository](#atom-and-packages) your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

## How Can I Contribute?

The Open Action Toolkit includes monthly communications and resources for advancing and advocating for **open access** , **open data** and **open education**.  We plan to address some of the following themes and could use your help:

* Exploring and choosing your action
* Crafting your message and inspiring engagement
* Getting to the finish line and connecting with other OA champions
* Telling the story of your efforts and successes

**We want to know about your ideas, work, and go-to resources for advancing openness.**  Are you planning something awesome for Open Access Week 2017?  What cool stuff have you created that others can use?  Can you point us to useful models, guides, lists, or outreach materials that other people have created?  Let us know, and we'll highlight them in the Open Action Kit's monthly communication and resources.

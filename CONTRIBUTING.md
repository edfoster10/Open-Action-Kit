## How Can I Contribute?

The Open Action Toolkit includes monthly communications and resources for advancing and advocating for **open access** **open data** and **open education**.  We plan to address some of the following themes and could use your help:

* Exploring and choosing your action
* Crafting your message and inspiring engagement
* Getting to the finish line and connecting with other OA champions
* Telling the story of your efforts and successes

We want to know about your ideas, work, and go-to resources for advancing openness.  Are you planning something awesome for Open Access Week 2017?  What cool stuff have you created that others can use?  Can you point us to useful models, guides, lists, or outreach materials that other people have created?  Let us know, and we'll highlight them in the Open Action Kit's monthly communication and resources.

### Pull Request

* **Check the [debugging guide](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/).** You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself. Most importantly, check if you can reproduce the problem [in the latest version of Atom](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#update-to-the-latest-version), if the problem happens when you run Atom in [safe mode](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-if-the-problem-shows-up-in-safe-mode), and if you can get the desired behavior by changing [Atom's or packages' config settings](http://flight-manual.atom.io/hacking-atom/sections/debugging/#check-atom-and-package-settings).
* **Check the [FAQs on the forum](https://discuss.atom.io/c/faq)** for a list of common questions and problems.
* **Determine [which repository the problem should be reported in](#atom-and-packages)**.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3Aatom)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

The Open Action Kit is a set of monthly resources designed to help you partipcate in OA Week 2017 and demonstrate all the ways that Open is making a difference!

**Does the prospect of organizing something for OA Week fill you with deep seated terror of even low lying anxiety?**  

Never fear, we're compiling a bunch of resources and tooks to help everyone, from novices to veterans!  We're here to help you **get inspired, connect with each other, make a plan, run a successful action, and tell the story of your success**.  Sound good, we thought so too.

**The toolkit will include monthly communications and resources that address the following themes:**  

* Exploring and choosing your action
* Crafting your message and inspiring engagement
* Getting to the finish line and connecting with other champions
* Telling the story of your efforts and success

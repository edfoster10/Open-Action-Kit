# This year’s theme for Open Access Week is “Open in Order to…” 

### No, that’s not a typo. Instead of filling in the blanks and telling you what Open facilitates, we’re interested in hearing about all the ways that Open makes things possible. Does Open increase impact? Ensure equity? Change the world?

We want to challenge those of you who are responsible for planning OA Week activities to demonstrate all the ways that Open is making a difference. This is precisely why we’re encouraging folks who are inspired to participate on OA Week to focus their action on forms of engagement that demonstrate the tangible, practical things that Open accomplishes. There are many forms this could take, including (but certainly not limited to) do-a-thons or social media campaigns. 

What are these things anyway? Glad you asked. 

A do-a-thon is, well, basically exactly what it sounds like. It’s an event that’s focused on organizing a group or community to takeing action, whether that’s doing or creating something. Think hack-a-thon, but more inclusive. No need to focus on technology here -- glue, paper, and whiteboards will do. Do-a-thons can be as small or large as you want them to be, so long as they keep in the spirit of getting stuff done. 

Social media campaigns are a little different. They consist of sharing deliberate messaging across a social media outlet (Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat) for a sustained period of time. Benefits of social media campaigns include raising awareness, increasing engagement across your communities, and maybe getting a few new followers.

Does the prospect of a do-a-thon, social media campaign, or organizing anything for OA Week fill you with a deep seated terror? Or even a low lying anxiety? Never fear, the Early Career Librarian Open Access Project is here! We’ve compiled a bunch of resources and tools to help everyone from novices to veterans. The ECLOA project is here to help you get inspired, connect with each other, make a plan, run a successful action, and tell the story of your success. Sound good? We thought so too.

The toolkit will include monthly communications and resources that address some of the following themes:
Exploring and choosing your action
Crafting your message and inspiring engagement
Getting to the finish line and connecting with other OA champions
Telling the story of your efforts and successes

We recognize that actions and resources are going to look different to everyone. This is why our resources will speak to ideas and goals across the spectrum of experience, whether you’re a New Natalia, Growing Gene, or Connected Cate. We’ve got a little something for everyone, so don’t you worry. 

So make sure you check this space in August. We’re going to get those creative juices flowing by introducing some different ways you can mobilize action and maximize engagement on your campus. 

Let us know if you have any questions, comments, suggested resources, stories, good jokes, etc. We wanna hear about all the cool stuff we know you’ve been up to (either currently or previously), so shrug off that modesty and hype yo self!

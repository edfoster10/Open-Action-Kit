## August
Wow, it's nearly September!  Have you decided how you'll be taking action for Open Acess Week?  If not, no worries!  Some of us are just getting started too, so we've complied some materials to help you choose your action and get a plan in place.  

### Let's get started!

First, take the [Open Action Kit Quiz](https://sparcopen.github.io/Open-Action-Kit/quiz) to get **suggested actions and resouces** based on your goals, advoacy experience, and resources.  It only takes a couple minutes, and it's kind of fun.

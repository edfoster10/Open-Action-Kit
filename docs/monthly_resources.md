## August
Wow, it's nearly September!  Have you decided how you'll be taking action for Open Acess Week?  If not, no worries!  Some of us are just getting started too, so we've complied some materials to help you **choose your action and create a plan**.
### Let's get started!
First, take the [Open Action Kit Quiz](https://sparcopen.github.io/Open-Action-Kit/quiz).  It will **suggest actions and resouces** based on your goals, advoacy experience, and resources.  It only takes a couple minutes, and it's kind of fun.

Already got an idea and ready to get started?  Great!  We've created a **[set of checklists](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3LrgRFGBovxeUtSbWtrSkxjeGM)** to help you identify next steps, and complete those little and big to-do items.

Whether you're planing a **awareness outreach, an on-campus event, an advocacy campaign, or a virtual activity, we've got you covered!**

## August
Wow, it's nearly September!  Have you decided how you'll be taking action for Open Acess Week?  If not, no worries!  Some of us are just getting started too, so we've complied some materials to help you **choose your action and create a plan**.
### Let's get started!
First, take the [Open Action Kit Quiz](https://sparcopen.github.io/Open-Action-Kit/quiz).  It will **suggest actions and tools** based on your goals, advoacy experience, and resources.  It only takes a couple minutes, and it's kind of fun.

Do you already have an idea? Ready to get started?  Great!  We've created a **[set of checklists](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3LrgRFGBovxeUtSbWtrSkxjeGM)** to help you identify next steps, and complete those little and big to-do items.

### Whether you're planing for awareness outreach, an on-campus event, an advocacy campaign, or a virtual activity, we've got you covered!
You can download the checklists and all of the resources we've curated for you this month in the [Open Action Kit's August Community Resources Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3LrgRFGBovxOGhxOE1VZnRrQkE).

### A couple more things to tell you about!
It's a lot of work to find and create resources to help with your action, so we started compiling a [list of the brochures, films, speaker lists, and other awesome stuff we use to take promote Open Access, Open Data, and Open Education](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10WoBOn1HLqyqw2cj1vI7_xgeU5wMI-7bjdfU62DxHDw/edit#gid=0).  

### Find inspiration, or add the great work you've created and used!
Finally, in the months ahead we'll be helping you build a plan for measuring the impact of your OA Week action, telling the story of your success, and translating that into your plans for next year.  To help you with that big picture, we've built a [timeline of important benchmarks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3LrgRFGBovxSV95ZEcySHpSOTA).  It will help you plan International Open Access Week initiatives months in advance to increase engagement!

Amal had a successful Open Access Week last year. Last year her library did a mini campaign by sending faculty postcards about Open Access Week and the institutional repository, and hosted a screening of The Internet’s Own Boy. She was thrilled at the success of last year, and wants to grow her library’s Open Access Week events this year! She will primarily be organizing the week alone, but would like to involve her colleagues in planning.

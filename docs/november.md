## November
Can you believe that OA Week is over? Make sure to look back on your experience and wins while things are still fresh in your mind. Reflecting on what went well and what you would improve can help you to advance your advocacy and outreach efforts next time around.  

Plus, the work you do during Open Access Week is part of your professional identity and accomplishments.  It's important to communicate this expertise and the impact of your work in CV, interview situations, and other professional contexts.  

### So, we've pulled together some resources to help you tell your story

Unsure of what, where, or how to report your OA Week activites?  Check out this document for tips and resources. 


Speaking of storytelling, next month we’re holding a webinar on crafting a professional competency narrative around your OA Week activities. We’ll chat about how to build straightforward explanations of the impact of your work and how to translate it into bite-sized chunks for a CV or interview situation. Mark your calendars for Wednesday, December 6th at 3 PM ET.
